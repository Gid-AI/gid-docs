# legacy_data

This directory contains old JSON/JSONL training files used in earlier versions of Gid's model training and data preparation processes.

## Purpose

These files represent historical training data formats and approaches that are no longer actively used in production. They serve as a reference for developers and data scientists who may need insight into previous methodologies, data preprocessing, or model tuning strategies.

## Contents

- **old_training_data.jsonl** and **old_training_data.json**: Sample legacy training files that were once used to shape Gid's initial responses and behaviors.
  
## Notes

- These files are **not** used for current training pipelines.
- They are maintained here for archival purposes, documentation, and historical research.
- Future developers may refer to these artifacts to understand how Gid's data sources, formatting, and preprocessing evolved over time.
