# README: GitHub Repository Setup for Gid

This document provides a simple, professional, and clean starting point for organizing your GitHub repositories for Gid. The goal is not to fully code the solution right now, but rather to establish a strong foundation and logical structure for your files and documents. 

## Guiding Principles

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Start with a small number of well-defined repositories. Avoid overly complex structures until you need them.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep code, documentation, and infrastructure separate. This makes navigation and future scaling easier.
3. **Flexibility**: The initial setup should be straightforward to adjust. 

## Recommended Base Repositories

1. **gid-backend**  
   Purpose: Store the backend source code, APIs, and business logic for Gid.  
   Contents:
   - `src/` directory for source code  
   - `tests/` for test files  
   - `README.md` with basic instructions and environment setup  
   Initially, you can just have an empty structure or a minimal `README.md` explaining this repo’s purpose.

2. **gid-frontend**  
   Purpose: Store the frontend code (if applicable) for Gid’s web interface.  
   Contents:
   - `src/` directory for UI components, pages, etc.  
   - `public/` for static assets (if needed)  
   - `README.md` describing build/run instructions.  
   Start with a simple README and empty folders. Actual code can be added later.

3. **gid-docs**  
   Purpose: Centralize all documentation (non-code documents), including architecture diagrams, operational guides, and internal documentation.  
   Contents:
   - `architecture/` for system diagrams (PNG, PDF, or draw.io/mermaid files)  
   - `dev_guides/` for developer onboarding docs, coding standards, style guides  
   - `deployment/` for notes on deployment steps, environment variables  
   - `README.md` that outlines how the documentation is organized.  
   Initially, this repository can be populated with existing Word docs, PDFs, and Markdown files. Just ensure they are neatly categorized.

4. **gid-infra**
   Purpose: Store infrastructure-related files (Terraform, deployment scripts), IAM configurations, or notes on environment setup.  
   Contents:
   - `README.md` explaining this is where infrastructure as code will live.  
   For now, keep it minimal. You can add files and directories (e.g., `terraform/`) later as infrastructure evolves.

5. **gid-ops** 
   Purpose: Store operational and monitoring guides, logging/monitoring configurations, or alerting rules.  
   Contents:
   - `README.md` describing that this will hold operational playbooks, runbooks, etc.  
   Initially, it can remain mostly empty until operational needs arise.

## Creating the Repositories on GitHub

1. **Repository Naming**:  
   Use clear, consistent names:
   - `gid-backend`
   - `gid-frontend`
   - `gid-docs`
   - `gid-infra`
   - `gid-ops`

2. **Initial Setup**:  
   On GitHub, create each repository in your organization’s account.  
   For each repo:
   - Add a `README.md` at creation time to describe its purpose.
   - Enable issues and a default branch (`main`).

3. **Local Cloning and Directory Structure**:  
   Once created, clone them locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-org/gid-backend.git
   cd gid-backend
   mkdir src tests
   echo "# Gid Backend" > README.md
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial structure"
   git push
